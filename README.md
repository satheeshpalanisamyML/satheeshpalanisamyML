### Step 5: Add Your Code and Files
1. **Upload Files**: Use the GitHub web interface or Git to push your code, data, and other files to the repository.
   - Example command to push files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main
     ```

### Step 6: Create a Portfolio Repository
1. **New Repository**: Create a new repository named something like `portfolio`.
2. **README.md**: In this repository, create a `README.md` that lists and links to all your project repositories.

### Step 7: Write Your Portfolio README.md
Here's a template for your portfolio README:

```markdown

## Projects

### [Fleet Clustering Of Drivers Data](https://github.com/yourusername/fleet-clustering)
A K Means Clustering Model developed to cluster the Drivers' data into segments based on input features. Elbow Method implemented to decide the optimum segments number.

### [Titanic Survivor Predictor](https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survivor-predictor)
A Predictor Model developed to point the prediction probability of a traveller on the Titanic Ship. Data Cleaning of Null Values implemented using an identified Pattern.

### [Spam SMS Detector](https://github.com/yourusername/spam-sms-detector)
A Natural Language Processing Use Case where Naive Bayes Classifier Model is used to classify the Spam SMS from the real ones. Tf-Idf Word Embedding is implemented.
